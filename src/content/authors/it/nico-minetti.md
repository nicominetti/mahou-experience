Chief Design Officer | UX Leader | Strategic Thinker with 12+ Years of Experience in Digital Product Design

As Chief Design Officer at Efenix, I lead the design vision and strategy across all digital products and services, aligning user experience with business goals and innovation. With over 12 years of experience in UX/UI, I’ve evolved from hands-on design to a leadership role where I empower teams, shape scalable design systems, and bridge the gap between users, technology, and business strategy.

I’m passionate about creating meaningful, user-centered solutions through collaborative design processes. My approach blends design thinking, agile methodologies, and a deep understanding of human behavior to deliver high-impact results—whether leading a team, mentoring designers, or co-creating with stakeholders.

Beyond interfaces, I design cultures: fostering creative environments, setting clear standards, and building cross-functional alignment. I'm driven by curiosity, clarity, and the constant pursuit of better experiences.
